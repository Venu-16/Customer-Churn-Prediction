# Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service or product based on historical data and relevant features.

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** Predict whether a customer will churn (discontinue service).
- **Approach:** Use a machine learning model to analyze customer data and identify churn patterns.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains customer information such as demographics, service usage, and subscription details.
- Typical features include customer tenure, contract type, monthly charges, and payment methods.

## Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Scale numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize key patterns and correlations
   - Identify important features

3. **Model Building:**
   - Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Compare models
   - Interpret results and improve model performance

## Accuracy 
   - Accuracy = 78%


## Contribution
   - Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues and submit pull requests to enhance the project.
